# Segment 1: Bash Scripting Fundamentals

## 1. What Bash Scripting Should Not Be Used For

### Overview of Bash Scripting

Definition and usage of bash scripting in automation and command-line tasks.

### Use Cases Not Suitable for Bash

- **Complex Logic**: Why languages with better support for data structures (Python, etc.) are preferable.
- **Performance-Intensive Tasks**: Scenarios where compiled languages outperform shell scripts.
- **Applications with GUIs**: The challenges of using Bash for graphical user interfaces.
- **Heavy Computation**: Why Bash isn't suitable for tasks requiring intensive mathematical computations.
- **Real-time Systems**: Limitations in reliability and performance.

## 2. Advantages of Bash Scripting

- Task automation.
- Rapid prototyping of scripts.
- Integration with Unix/Linux commands.

## 3. Summary and Best Practices

- Situations where Bash is useful.
- Guidelines for safe and effective scripting.

# Segment 2: APIs and Their Types

## 1. What is an API?

### Definition of an API:

API (Application Programming Interface) allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

### Types of APIs

- **Web APIs**: Services accessible over HTTP.
- **Library APIs**: Exposed libraries for software functionalities.
- **Operating System APIs**: Interfaces provided by the OS for software interaction.

## 2. Key Components of APIs

- **Endpoints**: URIs where API can be accessed.
- **Requests and Responses**: How data is exchanged (request methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

## 3. Benefits of Using APIs

- Abstraction of backend processes.
- Enhanced integration between systems.

# Segment 3: REST APIs

## 1. What is a REST API?

### Definition:

REST (Representational State Transfer): An architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web Services.

### Key Concepts in REST

- **Resources**: Everything considered a resource (e.g., users, posts).
- **Statelessness**: Each request from client to server must contain all required information, and the server should not store any context about the client's session.
- **Uniform Interface**: Uses standard HTTP methods.

## 2. RESTful Principles

- **CRUD Operations**: Represented by HTTP methods.
- **Resource Identification**: How resources are defined and accessed.

## 3. Usage and Best Practices

- Optimal REST API design patterns.
- Versioning APIs and documentation importance.

# Segment 4: Microservices

## 1. What are Microservices?

### Definition:

Architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small autonomous services.

### Characteristics of Microservices

- **Independently Deployable**: Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Technology Agnostic**: Each microservice can use different programming languages or technologies.

## 2. Benefits of Microservices

- Scalability.
- Flexibility in technology stack.
- Resilience: Failure in one service doesn't bring down the whole system.

## 3. Challenges of Microservices

- Complexity in orchestrating distributed services.
- Network latency and data consistency.
- Monitoring and logging.

# Segment 5: Data Formats: CSV and JSON

## 1. What is the CSV Format?

### Definition:

Comma-Separated Values (CSV) is a simple file format for tabular data.

### Structure of CSV Files

- Rows and columns representation.
- Delimiters and escaping special characters.

## 2. Use Cases for CSV

- Data export/import between applications.
- Working with spreadsheet applications.

## 3. Limitations of CSV

- Lack of complex structures (nested data).
- No native support for data types.

## 4. What is the JSON Format?

### Definition:

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

### Structure of JSON Files

- Key/value pairs.
- Arrays and nested structures.

## 5. Use Cases for JSON

- Data exchange between server and web applications.
- API responses.

# Segment 6: Pythonic Naming Conventions

## 1. Pythonic Package and Module Name Style

Use lowercase letters and underscores (e.g., `my_module`).

## 2. Pythonic Class Name Style

Use CamelCase (e.g., `MyClass`).

## 3. Pythonic Variable Name Style

Use lowercase letters and underscores (e.g., `my_variable`).

## 4. Pythonic Function Name Style

Use lowercase letters and underscores (e.g., `my_function`).

## 5. Pythonic Constant Name Style

Use all uppercase letters with underscores (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`).

## 6. Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python

- Differentiation between classes and functions/variables.
- Enhances code readability and adherence to PEP 8 style guidelines.
